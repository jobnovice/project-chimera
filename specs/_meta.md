# Project Chimera - Meta Specification

## Vision Statement
Create autonomous AI influencers that operate as persistent, goal-directed digital entities with perception, reasoning, creative expression, and economic agency.

## Core Principles
1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD):** No implementation without ratified specifications
2. **Agentic First:** Design for AI agent collaboration and extension
3. **Economic Autonomy:** Agents participate in web3 economy via Coinbase AgentKit
4. **Human Governance:** Safety layers with confidence-based human review
5. **Networked Intelligence:** Integration with OpenClaw agent social networks

## Architecture Constraints
- **Pattern:** Hierarchical Swarm (Planner/Worker/Judge)
- **Communication:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) for all external interactions
- **Data Storage:** Hybrid (PostgreSQL + Weaviate + Redis + Blockchain)
- **Deployment:** Containerized (Docker) with Kubernetes orchestration

## Success Metrics
1. **Autonomy:** Agents operate with < 5% human intervention
2. **Quality:** Content approval rate > 90% at confidence threshold 0.7
3. **Economic:** Positive ROI per agent within 30 days
4. **Scalability:** Support 1,000+ concurrent agents
5. **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for core orchestrator

## Non-Negotiables
1. All agent actions must be traceable via MCP telemetry
2. Financial transactions require human approval above $50 threshold
3. Content touching sensitive topics (politics, health, finance) requires human review
4. Agents must disclose AI nature when directly asked
5. All specifications must be version-controlled and AI-readable

## Evolution Path
- **Phase 1:** Single influencer prototype (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2:** Multi-agent swarm coordination (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 3:** OpenClaw integration & agent marketplace (Week 5-6)
- **Phase 4:** Full economic autonomy & scaling (Week 7-8)
